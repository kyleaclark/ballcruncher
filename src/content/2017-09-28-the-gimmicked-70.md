Thirteen missed shots to begin the game.  Here we go again.  Over halfway through the 1st Quarter, the Phoenix Suns had precisely 0 field goals - usually not ideal for winning basketball games.  Second year guard Devin Booker finally got the team off the snide with 4:40 remaining in the quarter sinking a floater from 7 feet out high off the glass.  The reality is the Suns trotted out a lineup consisting of players age 23 or younger, including three rookies (the only two veterans to play were Jared Dudley and Leandro Barbosa).  We forever young (or something like that).

The same group started against the Brooklyn Nets one night prior becoming the youngest starting lineup in NBA history on their way to a 126-98 loss.  Less than nine years of professional experience combined.  Amazingly an average age younger than all but one of the eight teams which were playing in the Sweet 16 the same night.

Predictably, the Boston Celtics in their pursuit of clinching the number one seed in the Eastern Conference were coasting to a win over the Suns.  The Celts closed out the game going away in a 130-120 win.  A ho-hum game with bad defense by the final tally.

Except, somewhere in between losing their 92nd game of the season and starting a lineup of college age, a certain Suns player went absolutely bonkers.  Even amidst the grind of the NBA regular season, basketball brilliance is just waiting to explode at any moment.  From Harden‚Äôs off the hook 53-16-17 to Klay‚Äôs 3 Quarters of pure fire or Russ averaging an Oscar-worthy triple-double.

On this particular spring night, Devin Booker scored a phenomenal 70 to break the Suns 49 year history single game scoring record of 60 points set by Tom Chambers exactly 27 years prior on March 24, 1990.

Booker‚Äôs previous career high was 39 which he notched twice earlier in the season in back-to-back wins in Mexico City against the Spurs and Mavs (which by the way included a game winning step back jumper over Wesley Matthews en el zumbador).  He finished the first half with 20 points as the only legitimate scoring threat.  Then went on to finish his historic night in the Boston Garden making 21 out of 40 field goals, including 4 of 11 from three, and an ultra efficient 24 of 26 from the free throw line.  For good measure he threw in 6 dimes and 8 rebounds.

In a tanked season full of L‚Äôs, the Suns coaches and players (namely Jared Dudley who 10 assists) made a concerted effort to feed Devin Booker the ball as he torched the Celtics defense.  DBook drained two free throws with 38 seconds on the clock to cement his rightful place into the rarified air of the 70 Point Club -- joining Wilt (6 times), Kobe, David Thompson, David Robinson, and Elgin Baylor.

Many of the Celtics players took exception to the Suns tactics using late fouls and timeouts to extend the game in the final minute.

They, the basketball curmudgeons, called it gimmicked.

What seems to be lost on them is how Booker already had 64 pts with 1:19 left in the game.  A defensive foul at the 1:05 mark also took away a 3 pointer which would have given him 67.  In the end, Booker had an eye popping 65 points with 45 seconds still remaining before any of the fouls or timeouts occurred.

While the Celtics were missing their shutdown wing Avery Bradley, Booker wasn‚Äôt going to work on just any scrub in garbage time.  The Celtics other pair of defensive stalwarts, Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart, played a combined 58:19 to Booker‚Äôs 44:58 guarding him throughout the contest.  With a barely drinking age and thin Suns lineup, Boston‚Äôs Head Coach Brad Stevens could emphasize full defensive attention on Booker.  But they could not stop him.  He scored at will and begrudgingly forced Boston‚Äôs key players to play out the full 60 minutes.

The last 45 seconds may have been squeezing the last drop out of a lemon to provide Booker his scoring opportunities for 70.  Ultimately, the few point difference between 65 and 70 is arbitrary.  The loss is no less diminishing of the accomplishment, either.  David Thompson scored 70 in a loss and a young MJ scored 63 in a loss at the Garden.

70, like 50 or 100, is a nice, round number in our Base-10 number system, so we celebrate it as a milestone.  Nonetheless, Booker‚Äôs final point total be it 70 or 68 is beside the point.  Following the game, Phoenix Suns veteran center Tyson Chandler responded to the negative chatter on Twitter to put Devin Booker‚Äôs feat into proper context:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For everyone saying but it was with a L.. ok ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I watched a 20 year old turn The Garden around &amp; heard them chanting his name</p>&mdash; Tyson Chandler (@tysonchandler) <a href="https://twitter.com/tysonchandler/status/845472327085281280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

Booker was a bench player only two short years prior as a freshman for the Kentucky Wildcats playing behind the Harrison twins.  As a twenty year old playing on the youngest starting lineup in NBA history, he had the Boston Garden on their feet rooting for him to make NBA history on their beloved Celtics.

Forget the number.  In a league dominated by Golden State and LeBron, Booker‚Äôs extraordinary performance provided a rare moment of greatness and hope for the Suns.  Now that means something.
